# CyberAgentToolSet (CATS)

> * An MCP server + CLI that orchestrates authorized security assessments across the attack lifecycle (reconnaissance · scanning · gaining-access) via installable extensions.
> * Works as a standalone CLI **and** as a live MCP server that gives Claude direct access to every capability.
> * **⚠️ Only test systems you own or have explicit written authorisation to assess. Unauthorised scanning may violate laws and regulations.**

## What it does

CyberAgentToolSet (CATS) orchestrates reconnaissance workflows defined in YAML playbooks. Point it at a target, pick one or more topic-based playbooks, and it runs every check — DNS, WHOIS, port scan, HTTP headers, TLS, subdomain enumeration, and more — then saves structured JSON + Markdown reports (and optional PDF/DOCX).

When the MCP server is running, Claude can drive the entire workflow interactively: list available topics, ask which ones you want, run the selected playbooks, and present findings — all in natural language.

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Install from npm (exposes `cyberagent` and `cyberagent-mcp`)
npm install -g cyberagent-toolset

# 2. Run a quick recon
cyberagent -p quick-web-recon --target example.com

# 3. Or start the MCP server for Claude
cyberagent-mcp
```

Prefer to run from source? Clone the repo, `npm install`, then use
`node src/index.js …` in place of `cyberagent` (and `npm run mcp` for the server):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aboidrees/cyberagent-toolset.git
cd cyberagent-toolset && npm install
node src/index.js -p playbooks/quick-web-recon.yaml --target example.com
```

Reports are saved to `runs/` as `.json` and `.md`.

---

## Automation (CLI)

```bash
# Auto-run every applicable executor (no playbook); --passive for OSINT-only scope
node src/index.js auto --target cyberany.org

# List capabilities by phase / posture / domain
node src/index.js capabilities

# Diff two runs (exits non-zero when something changed)
node src/index.js diff runs/old.json runs/new.json

# Batch-run a watchlist of targets + playbooks
node src/index.js watch --list watchlists/example.yaml

# Schedule a recurring scan (new findings fire webhooks)
node src/index.js schedule --playbook quick-web-recon --target fortmind.qa --cron "0 8 * * 1"

# Export a run to PDF / DOCX / HTML
node src/index.js report runs/run.json --format pdf --out report.pdf
```

Parallel steps (`parallel: true`), an executive-summary + risk-matrix in every
report, and Slack/webhook notifications (`SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` / `WEBHOOK_URL`) are
built in. See [Configuration](docs/configuration.md).

## Agent-driven assessments

Beyond one-shot playbooks, CATS runs **stateful assessments** — the way an AI
agent (or you) drives a full investigation. Each result feeds an **entity graph**
(subdomains, IPs, ports, URLs, CVEs…) and a **pivot engine** that suggests the
next best actions: a discovered subdomain queues a web/TLS sweep, an open `445`
queues `smb.probe`, an unscored CVE queues `vuln.epss`. The final report
correlates findings (CVE × EPSS exploit-probability) into a prioritized list.

```bash
node src/index.js assess start example.com --full      # one command: drive the whole assessment → report
node src/index.js assess start example.com          # or step through it: id + ranked next steps
node src/index.js assess run  <id> --top 5           # run the top suggestions; new pivots surface
node src/index.js assess next <id>                   # see the updated ranked actions
node src/index.js assess report <id>                 # prioritized, correlated report (Markdown/JSON)
node src/index.js assess report <id> --format pdf   # export PDF/DOCX/HTML (like a run)
node src/index.js assess diff <idA> <idB>            # compare a target over time
```

Over MCP the same loop is `cats_assess_start → cats_assess_run → cats_assess_next
→ cats_assess_report`, so Claude can conduct and reason about the whole
assessment conversationally.

## Web dashboard

A local browser UI to browse assessments and runs, drive an assessment
(start → run → prioritized report), and diff two runs:

```bash
node src/index.js dashboard            # → http://127.0.0.1:7878
```

Localhost-bound by design (it can trigger active scans). No new dependency — it's
built on Node's `http` and reuses the same assessment engine.

---

## Available playbooks

Pass any playbook **id** straight to `-p` (no path or `.yaml` needed) — it resolves
against the bundled playbooks, so it works the same whether CATS is installed
globally or run from source. Run `cyberagent playbooks` to list them all with
their steps and executors.

```bash
cyberagent playbooks                                  # list every playbook
cyberagent -p quick-web-recon --target example.com    # run one by id
```
